      `I know sometimes you look in the mirror and wonder if you're enough if you're attractive if you're someone worth being loved and I just want to hold your face in my hands and tell you yes yes a million times yes you are so beautiful to me in ways that words can‚Äôt even explain your eyes your smile the way your face lights up when you're excited your laugh your voice your presence all of it is beautiful and I mean that every single time I say it you don‚Äôt need to change anything about yourself for me to love you more because I already love you so much just as you are your flaws your insecurities your soft spots they don‚Äôt make you less they make you real and that makes you even more special I wish you could see yourself through my eyes even for a moment you‚Äôd see someone kind someone handsome someone worth holding onto someone who makes my world brighter just by existing please don‚Äôt ever doubt the way I feel about you or the way you look to me you‚Äôre perfect in your own way not because of how you fit into some standard but because you're you and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever needed i wil choose you a million times over and love you always in the same way as now my love`,
      `I know you're hurting right now and maybe everything feels too heavy and nothing anyone says can fix it and I won‚Äôt pretend to have all the right words but I just want you to know that I‚Äôm here I see you I feel you and I‚Äôm not going anywhere no matter what I know you get quiet when you're sad like you're trying to carry it all on your own but you don‚Äôt have to not with me you can fall apart in front of me and I will hold every broken piece gently without judgment without pressure just with love because I love you not only when you're smiling but even more when you're not even when you're tired or overwhelmed or unsure or lost even when the world feels dark I want to be your light and I want you to know this sadness does not make you any less it doesn‚Äôt make you weak it doesn‚Äôt make you hard to love in fact it makes me want to hold you even closer you're still beautiful even in your sadness still worthy still enough I wish I could wrap my arms around you right now and make you feel how safe you are with me how much I care how proud I am of you just for being here just for trying I love you and I‚Äôm not going anywhere not today not ever`,
      `When you miss me, my love, I want you to know I‚Äôm missing you too ‚Äî in every moment, with every breath, in ways that words can‚Äôt even explain. You're not just a thought in my mind, you're a part of me, stitched into everything I do, everything I feel. When you're not around, it‚Äôs like something in the world is quieter, a little slower, a little softer ‚Äî because your presence brings everything to life for me. I miss the way your eyes look at me like I‚Äôm the only one that matters, the way your voice makes everything feel okay, the way your touch makes my whole world feel safe. I miss your laugh, your hugs, your little habits, even the way you say my name ‚Äî I crave all of it. And when you miss me, I want you to wrap yourself in the truth that my love for you never pauses, never fades, never leaves ‚Äî not for a second. You are mine and I am yours, always, no matter where we are. So when it gets hard, close your eyes and feel me there ‚Äî feel my love holding you, soothing you, kissing every lonely thought away. We may be apart right now, but nothing, not time, not distance, not silence, can come between the way I love you. I am always with you, baby ‚Äî in every beat of your heart, in every dream, in every piece of love I have left behind just for you. You are never alone, not for a moment, and you never will be ‚Äî because I love you with everything I am. üíï`,
      `Whenever you start to doubt yourself, or feel like you‚Äôre not enough, I want you to remember this ‚Äî you are everything to me. I don‚Äôt love you because you're always strong or because you never struggle. I love you because of your heart, your softness, your honesty, your effort ‚Äî even on the days when it feels like you‚Äôre falling apart. I see you, even when you try to hide. I see the way you care so deeply, the way you overthink because you want to do right by everyone, the way you carry so much silently and still manage to smile. That‚Äôs strength, that‚Äôs love, and that‚Äôs why I will never stop choosing youI love you soooooooo bad ‚Äî like it hurts in the most beautiful way. I love you so much it‚Äôs in everything I do, in every thought I have, in every breath I take. I love you when I wake up and you're the first person on my mind. I love you when I miss you so much it aches a little. I love you when I‚Äôm smiling for no reason because just thinking of you lights me up inside. It‚Äôs not just love, it‚Äôs something deeper ‚Äî it‚Äôs like my soul reaches for yours, always. I love you with the kind of intensity that I can't even put into words properly, the kind that lives in the bones, in the heartbeat, in the way I‚Äôd choose you again and again, in every lifetime.`,
      `When you feel lonely, I want you to close your eyes and remember that you are never truly alone ‚Äî because I‚Äôm with you, in spirit, in love, in every quiet part of your heart where my name lives. I know the silence can feel heavy sometimes, and the world can feel like it's pulling away, but please remember this: you are loved more than you know. Even when I‚Äôm not right there beside you, I‚Äôm still holding you close in every possible way I can. My thoughts are wrapped around you, my love is holding your hand from afar, and my heart beats with yours. You don‚Äôt have to go through anything alone ‚Äî not your sadness, not your fears, not the nights that feel a little colder. I am here, always, loving you so deeply, so completely, with everything I have. So when it feels like no one understands, when the quiet gets too loud, when you just wish someone was there ‚Äî let that someone be me. Imagine me whispering softly, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôre loved. You‚Äôre mine.‚Äù I‚Äôm with you, baby. Always.`,
      `Whenever life feels too heavy, whenever you feel tired or overwhelmed or unsure of where to go next, I want you to remember something ‚Äî you‚Äôre not alone. You don‚Äôt have to carry everything by yourself. You don‚Äôt have to be strong all the time. I am right here, and I‚Äôm not going anywhere. Lean on me when you need to. Let me be your safe place, your quiet when the world gets too loud. I believe in you even when you don‚Äôt believe in yourself. I see how hard you're trying, how much you care, how deeply you feel ‚Äî and I love all of it. You don‚Äôt have to hide your struggles with me. You don‚Äôt have to pretend. I will stand beside you in the storm, hold your hand through the dark, and remind you again and again that you are worthy, you are loved, and you are never facing this world alone. I‚Äôve got you, completely, and I always will. Whatever you need ‚Äî a voice, a hug, a break, a reminder ‚Äî I‚Äôm here. Always.`,
      `I know I seem upset right now, and maybe I‚Äôve gone a little quiet, but I need you to understand something ‚Äî I still love you. So much. That hasn‚Äôt changed for a second. I just need a little space to feel what I‚Äôm feeling, to process it in my own way, but it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôve stopped caring or because I‚Äôve stopped choosing you. It‚Äôs the opposite ‚Äî I care so much that it hurts sometimes, and I feel things deeply, especially when it comes to you. But even in this moment, even when my heart feels a little heavy, you are still the person I want, the person I love, the person I see my world in. I just need a little time, not distance. I need you to know this isn't the end ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a pause, a breath, a moment. And when I'm ready, I‚Äôll come back softer, closer, and still completely yours. Please don‚Äôt doubt my love, even when I‚Äôm hurting. It‚Äôs still there ‚Äî constant, quiet, and waiting to wrap around you again`,
     `If one day you ever feel tired of me, if I no longer feel like enough for you, and your heart begins to drift ‚Äî please just be honest with me. I won‚Äôt beg you to stay, and I won‚Äôt hold you back from something that makes you happier. As much as it would break me, I‚Äôll let you go ‚Äî with love, with grace, and with peace in my heart ‚Äî because your happiness means more to me than my own pride or pain. And if ever someone else makes you feel something stronger, something more than what I could give, I‚Äôll step aside. I won‚Äôt stand in the way of your joy. I‚Äôll cry in silence maybe, I‚Äôll heal slowly, but I‚Äôll never curse your name or regret loving you ‚Äî because loving you has always been one of the most beautiful parts of my life. I will always support you, even from afar, even when you no longer call me yours. That‚Äôs how real my love is ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt ask for anything in return, it just wishes you peace, love, and everything good. Always.`,
      `I want you to know that I‚Äôm not just here for now ‚Äî I‚Äôm here for always. One day, I will be your wife, and not just in name, but in every little thing that matters. I‚Äôll be the kind of woman who stands by you no matter what, the kind who loves you deeply and never lets you feel alone. I will take care of you, support you, protect your peace, and be your home when the world feels cold. I promise you this ‚Äî I will love and respect your parents like my own. I will never let them feel a single moment of sadness or complain because of me. I will stand by your side with pride and softness, through every high and every low. I‚Äôll choose you even when things get hard, and I‚Äôll fight for you ‚Äî even if that means going against the people I love, even if that means standing up to my own parents, because you are my person, and I won‚Äôt let anything come between us. My love for you is real, loyal, and forever. I‚Äôll be your peace, your strength, your reason to smile. You‚Äôre not just the man I love ‚Äî you're the man I want to build everything with`,
      `If you ever start to doubt us, please pause and remember this ‚Äî I will do anything for you, for us, for the love we‚Äôve built. No matter what happens, no matter how hard things get, I‚Äôm not going anywhere. I didn‚Äôt choose you for just the good days, I chose you for all of it ‚Äî the storms, the silence, the doubts, the healing. I‚Äôm here with my whole heart, ready to fight for us again and again, because you‚Äôre worth it. This love is worth it. Even if you push me away, even if you question everything, I will still choose you, still believe in us. I will remind you how strong we are, how far we've come, and how much more we have ahead of us. I‚Äôll prove it with every action, every word, every single day. I will stand beside you when you‚Äôre scared, hold you when you‚Äôre tired, and love you even when you don‚Äôt know how to love yourself. You and me ‚Äî we‚Äôre not something I take lightly. I‚Äôm in this, heart and soul, forever. So when your mind fills with doubt, let my love remind you ‚Äî I‚Äôm not giving up on us. Ever..`,
      `You say you want to understand me, but have you really tried? I changed everything for you. I left behind the people I loved, I gave up things that mattered to me, I made sacrifices you‚Äôll never fully know ‚Äî all because I chose you. Again and again. But now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm tired of trying to explain myself, tired of begging to be seen, tired of hoping that one day you‚Äôll finally understand the depth of what I feel. I can‚Äôt keep asking for love like it‚Äôs something I have to earn or fight for. I can‚Äôt beg for your time, your attention, or your heart. That‚Äôs not love ‚Äî that‚Äôs pain. And I‚Äôm not asking for anything more than what I‚Äôve already given ‚Äî just a little effort, a little care, a little understanding. I cry silently for the love I‚Äôve poured into you. I break down wishing you‚Äôd just try ‚Äî really try ‚Äî to understand me. Not because I‚Äôm perfect, but because I‚Äôm yours. Please‚Ä¶ try to understand me. Not just with your words, but with your heart I‚Äôm scared. Scared that one day your heart might get tired of me‚Ä¶ tired of my love‚Ä¶ and someone new will take my place. That maybe she‚Äôll smile in ways I couldn‚Äôt, understand you in ways I tried, and love you in ways you stop seeing in me. And the thought of that ‚Äî of losing you, of watching you drift away from me ‚Äî it kills me from the inside. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it. I feel like I‚Äôd completely fall apart, like something inside me would just end. Because you‚Äôre not just someone I love‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre everything. You‚Äôre my person, my peace, my home. And the idea of you giving your heart to someone else ‚Äî it terrifies me in ways I can‚Äôt even describe. I don‚Äôt want to lose you. I don‚Äôt want to be replaced. I don‚Äôt want to wake up one day and realize your love isn‚Äôt mine anymore. Please‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt let that happen. Please choose me. Again and again. Like I choose you, every single day  don‚Äôt even know how to breathe without you anymore. I thought I could be strong, I thought I could let go with grace, but the truth is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm falling apart without you. I feel empty, like a part of me died the moment we drifted away. I act cold, I act like I‚Äôm okay, but inside, I‚Äôm screaming for you. I want you to come back. I want you to hold me, to tell me it‚Äôs not over, that we‚Äôre still ‚Äúus.‚Äù I can‚Äôt do this without you. I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt even pretend I‚Äôm fine. You were my safe place. My everything.`,
      `If we ever broke up, no matter how much it hurts me, I would still always support you. Your happiness will always mean something to me ‚Äî because it was mine too. But the truth is‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt live without you. I try to act strong, I try to act cold, but inside I‚Äôm breaking. Please‚Ä¶ come back to me. Please don‚Äôt leave me. I said things I didn‚Äôt mean, I pushed you away when all I wanted was for you to hold me and not let go. I‚Äôm not okay without you. I won‚Äôt ever be. You were my peace, my comfort, my everything ‚Äî and without you, I feel lost. I feel empty. Please come back. Please forgive me. Please hold me one more time and remind me that love doesn‚Äôt just disappear. You are my last hope. The only one who can calm the storm inside me. I love you more than I‚Äôve ever loved anything, and I don‚Äôt want to lose you. Not now. Not like this. Please‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt give up on me. I need you. I don‚Äôt even know how to breathe without you anymore. I thought I could be strong, I thought I could let go with grace, but the truth is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm falling apart without you. I feel empty, like a part of me died the moment we drifted away. I act cold, I act like I‚Äôm okay, but inside, I‚Äôm screaming for you. I want you to come back. I want you to hold me, to tell me it‚Äôs not over, that we‚Äôre still ‚Äúus.‚Äù I can‚Äôt do this without you. I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt even pretend I‚Äôm fine. You were my safe place. My everything. And now I feel like I‚Äôm floating in a world where nothing makes sense. Yes, I made mistakes. Yes, I said things I wish I could take back. But I was hurt‚Ä¶ scared‚Ä¶ trying to protect my heart while it was already bleeding. I didn‚Äôt mean to push you away. I just wanted you to fight for me. I just wanted you to stay. You‚Äôre the last person I ever wanted to lose, and now all I can do is beg silently, hopelessly ‚Äî please come back. Please don‚Äôt leave me like this. Please don‚Äôt let this be the end. Without you, I‚Äôm not just heartbroken‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm lost. I‚Äôm empty. I‚Äôm nothing. You were my last hope, and I‚Äôm begging you with everything that‚Äôs left in me ‚Äî please don‚Äôt let go`
